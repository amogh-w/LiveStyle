## About The Project:

Art is a highly diverse range of human activities engaged in creating visual, auditory, or performed artifacts — artworks — that express the author’s imaginative or technical skill, and are intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power.

We attempt to create an algorithmic process and thus implement an artificial system in fine arts. Fine art, especially in painting, humans have mastered the skill to create unique visual experiences through composing a complex interplay between the content and style of an image. In areas of visual perception such as object and face recognition, there has been extraordinary progress in achieving near-human performance by the virtue of Deep Neural Networks.

Here we introduce an artificial system based on a Deep Neural Network that creates artistic images of high perceptual quality. The neural algorithm will separate and recombine content and style of arbitrary images using neural representations of them, this will create artistic images.

Our work paves a path to an algorithmic understanding of human nature to create artistic imagery and thus has tremendous potential for having various applications in different fields.
